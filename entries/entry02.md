> For my project I have decided to use <a href="https://ml5js.org/">Ml5</a> a machine learning tool for the web, that runs in your web browser. 
I have chosen this tool because it perfectly suits my needs. I have done some tinkering with it, and it is challenging enough for me to explore while having somewhat of an understanding of the code.
