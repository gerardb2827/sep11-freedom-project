# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Gerard Bankhead**

## Context
The _"Freedom Project"_ for SEP11 is all about independently learning a tool and creating a project with that tool. The purpose of this blog is to take the reader on my journey, and thought process in how I came up with this project.

## Content
For my project, I am making an image classifier for insects. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Machine Learning in order to make this classifier.

## Implications
This project could be used to help people judge their safety. With more images, training and labels, this could be used to quickly identify bugs around you. You could then judge weither or not your safe to be around that bug, or if you should take extra precautions.
